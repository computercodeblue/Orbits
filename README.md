#A set of classes to work with MyLaps Orbits

ComputerCodeBlue.Orbits is a C# library designed to work with the MyLaps Orbits race scoring software. You can use this library to generate a "groupsandruns.xml" file to import into Orbits at the start of your race day. The intent is to allow you to export a list of competitors from your point-of-sale or website and import them into Orbits in a minute.
